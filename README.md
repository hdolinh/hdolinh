## Hi there 👋🏽

*Pronouns (she/her/hers)*

👩🏽‍💻 I am a recent graduate from the <a href="https://ucsb-meds.github.io/">Master's of Environmental Data Science program</a> at UCSB's Bren School for Environmental Science & Management. My long-term goal is to apply data science to find equitable solutions for environmental issues affecting urban watersheds. 

✨ Currently, I am an R Shiny Developer Fellow at the Bren School where I am designing, developing, and deploying a Shiny dashboard that communicates data related to their graduate programs.

♻️ Previously, I was a Climate & Energy Fellow at CalRecycle where I developed energy efficiency resources for recycled-content product manufacturers in California.
