## Hi there 👋🏽

*Pronouns (she/her/hers)*

👩🏽‍💻 I am a Master's Candidate of Environmental Data Science at UCSB's Bren School for Environmental Science & Management. My long-term goal is to apply data science to science communications that is equitable and inclusive, but as I go through my graduate program I expect this to evolve. 

♻️ Most recently, I was a Climate & Energy Fellow at CalRecycle where I developed curated energy efficiency resources for recycled-content product manufacturers in California.
