## Hi there 👋🏽

*Pronouns (she/her/hers)*

I am a MEDS candidate at UCSB's Bren School for Environmental Science & Management. My long-term goal is to apply data science to science communications that is equitable and inclusive, but as I go through my graduate program I expect this to evolve. 


- 🌱👾 I’m currently learning environmental data science!
- 💬 I’m looking to chat about data science projects related to environmental justice, food waste, or climate science.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with best data science practices.
- 📫 How to reach me: halina@bren.ucsb.edu
- 🏕 Fun fact: I have camped for 100 days straight in beautiful Californa.
