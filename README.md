## Hi there 👋🏽

*Pronouns (she/her/hers)*

👩🏽‍💻 I am a Data Analyst at the City of Los Angeles, Department of Transportation. I work on projects related to new mobility and technologies in transportation (think: delivery robots, autonomous vehicles, e-bikes, scooters).

🎓 I am an alumnus of the [Master's of Environmental Data Science](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/) inaugural cohort - a graduate program at UCSB's Bren School for Environmental Science & Management. 

✨ Previously, I was the [Learning Hub](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/learning-hub) Program Manager at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) and worked on data science training programs hosted in the Learning Hub, and supported scientists and their data science goals.

🤓 Some of my other projects:

- [Bren Student Data Explorer](https://shinyapps.bren.ucsb.edu/student-data-explorer/) - a Shiny dashboard that communicates career outcomes and student demographics of Bren graduate students. Designed, developed, and deployed by me :-)
- [Outdoor Equity App](https://github.com/outdoor-equity/) - a Shiny web app developed by me and [Clarissa Boyajian](https://cboyajian.github.io/) to explore patterns of visitor use of reservable overnight sites (such as campgrounds, cabins, hike-in, and more) to support equitable access to the outdoors.
